# mcz_subcell

This is a simple repo to collect code and documentations from the pilot project kicking off as part of the CZI Neurodegeneration Challenge Network [(NDCN)](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/neurodegeneration-challenge/) Data Science Concierge program.  The PILOT study is a collaboration with Cohen lab at UNC [(website,](https://cohenlaboratory.web.unc.edu/) [github)](https://github.com/SCohenLab) to migrate a multispectral imaging dataset of iPSCs which identifies sub-cellular components to a scalable cloud-based pipeline.

The repo currently contains some existing R scripts ( [src/](/src) ), CellProfiler scripts ( [cellprofiler/](/cellprofiler) ) and documents detailing the analysis pipeline, iPSC incubation protocols, and imaging specs ( [docs/](/docs) ). As additional scripts and Jupyter notebooks are developed they will also be added here.
