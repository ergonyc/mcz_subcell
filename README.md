# mcz_subcell

This is a simple repo to collect code and documentations from the pilot project kicking off as part of the CZI Neurodegeneration Challenge Network [(NDCN)](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/neurodegeneration-challenge/) Data Science Concierge program.  The PILOT study is a collaboration with Cohen lab at UNC [(website,](https://cohenlaboratory.web.unc.edu/) [github)](https://github.com/SCohenLab) to migrate a multispectral imaging dataset of iPSCs which identifies sub-cellular components to a scalable cloud-based pipeline.

The repo currently contains some existing R scripts ( [src/](/src) ), CellProfiler scripts ( [cellprofiler/](/cellprofiler) ) and documents detailing the analysis pipeline, iPSC incubation protocols, and imaging specs ( [docs/](/docs) ). As additional scripts and Jupyter notebooks are developed they will also be added here.

[uploading files via the workspace article](https://knowledgebase.aridhia.io/article/uploading-files-via-the-workspace/).
[Using BLOB storage](https://knowledgebase.aridhia.io/article/using-blob-storage/)

### Uploading files to Blobs
> The file upload to Blob storage follows the process described in [uploading files via the workspace article](https://knowledgebase.aridhia.io/article/uploading-files-via-the-workspace/). Note that due to the nature of Blob storage, folder hierarchies cannot exist without content. This means that you won't be able to create empty folders, and after refreshing the page the empty folders will be gone from your Blob storage. There is a workaround: you can create an empty folder, and without closing the window, add or upload a new file to the folder.
